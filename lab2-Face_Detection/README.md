1) The task provides basic code including data reading, basic model, model training, etc  
2) Contestants need to complete the core model construction code and adjust the model to the best possible state  
3) The single inference time of the model shall not exceed 10 seconds  

You can use Python based OpenCV library for image correlation processing, Numpy library for related numerical operations, and use frameworks such as Tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch to establish deep learning models.
