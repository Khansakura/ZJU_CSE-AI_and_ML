The experimental indicators are average absolute percentage error (MAPE) and average absolute error (MAE).  
Base on python `Pandas` 、 `Numpy` 、`Scikit-learn` and `Keras`、`TensorFlow`、`PyTorch`  
   
Final: MAPE=0.0215, MAE=0.5978. Not bad I think, but they can still be improved by choosing better parameter, eta.
