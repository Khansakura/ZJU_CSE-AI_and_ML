1) Establish a deep learning model to detect whether the person in the picture is wearing a mask and adjust it to the best possible state.

2) Learn the structure of classic models MTCNN and MobileNet.

3) Methods for learning and training.
You can use Python based OpenCV and PIL libraries for image correlation processing, Numpy libraries for related numerical operations, and deep learning frameworks such as Keras to train models.
