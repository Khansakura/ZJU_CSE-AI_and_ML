-Use Python language.

-Use basic search algorithms to complete robot maze walking.

-Use Deep QLearing algorithm to complete robot maze walking.

-The algorithm part needs to be implemented by oneself and cannot use ready-made packages, tools, or interfaces.

Basic algorithms can be implemented using Python, and Deep QLearing algorithms can be implemented using frameworks such as Keras and PyTorch.
